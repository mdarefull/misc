# Welcome to my Knowledge Map!

The intend of this application is to provide a way of registering references to valuable resources.
Then, the application will provide different options to seek the references in the future.

The goal of this idea, is that when I find a valuable resource (usually knowledge), I add a reference to it as part of a subject.
In the future, subjects can be refactored to make several of its resources conform a sub-subject of it.
Then, time after, maybe days, maybe months. If there's the situation where the knowledge of a subject can be useful, I look for it,
get all its references and re-learn (remember) the subject.

This represents the lighter and practical approach I've found to study and advance on this career. Now I won't have to expend huge
amount of time and resources learning something that I may not use for a long time and potentially becoming obsolete.
I simply learn an information (by properly understanting it) and then add a reference to it.
If, time passed, I happens to need the information, I look the reference and remember it (a much easier process once the information has been previously understood).
If I happens to never need it (or it become obsole) I just remove the reference if I happen to see it again.

With this approach, I only have to know the subjects I have created (I have references for), and, their applications.
For example: If I learn about a Suffix Array, I only need to remember that I've learned it, and its applications.
If in the future I come across with one of the problems it solves, 
I only need to be able to recognize that the Suffix Array solves it and then seek for the references to the SuffixArray on the application
and seek the proper resource and remember how to actually solve the problem (it can simply be copy-paste a previously developed algorithm).


This application should be wonderful in conjuction with some Active Recall application. So that first when I add a subject to it,
I only need to worry to perfectly remember the 2-way tool <==> application.
When I have this knowledge matured, then I calculate the pros and cons (always the investemt in time and effort) of
remembering the tool with a high level of detail, maybe what it is, is abstract functionalities, etc...
And so on... (a 3rd, 4th, etc... evaluation) to calculate whether it may be valuable to dive in deeper...
